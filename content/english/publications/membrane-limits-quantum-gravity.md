#### Abstract

It is expected that infinite distance limits in the moduli space of quantum gravity are accompanied by a tower of light states. In view of the Emergent String Conjecture, this tower must either induce a decompactification or correspond to the emergence of a tensionless critical string. We study the consistency conditions implied by this conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of quantum gravity under dimensional reduction. If the emergent string descends from a (2+1)-dimensional membrane in a higher-dimensional theory, we find that such a membrane must parametrically decouple from the Kaluza-Klein scale. We verify this censorship against emergent membrane limits, where the membrane would sit at the Kaluza-Klein scale, in the hypermultiplet moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications of string/M-theory. At the classical level, a putative membrane limit arises, up to duality, from an M5-brane wrapping the asymptotically shrinking special Lagrangian 3-cycle corresponding to the SYZ fibre of the Calabi-Yau. We show how quantum corrections in the moduli space obstruct such a limit and instead lead to a decompactification to eleven dimensions, where the role of the M5- and M2-branes are interchanged.
